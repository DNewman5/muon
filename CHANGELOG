Muon 0.1 (Alpha) Released 2017-01-25
* An option to fix for vertical building placement in villages to
  eliminate the all too common problem of inaccessible elevated or
  buried doors.
* An option to fix "broken" terrain around villages, ensuring paths
  are always accessible within a village and don't drop off the side
  of mountains.
* An option to use alternate path generation code to make them look
  a bit better, and also create simple bridges across small rivers.
* An option to ensure scattered features like temples and igloos are
  always accessible. Igloos would sometimes spawn *INSIDE* hills.
* No change in the number of randoms taken from the seed pool, so your
  world seeds still generate the same world!
