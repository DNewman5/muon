This is a vague list of ideas that *MAY* be implemented in the future.

None of this is set in stone, and final implementations may not even
resemble the ideas outlined here. We will, however, make some attempt
to keep it up to date.

* Control over village frequency
  - must disable (or otherwise avoid conflict) with MoVillages.

* Control over village biomes
  - do this based on biome metadata so it works across biome types?
  - this would make it work in modded biomes also?
  - will need careful consideration of which metadata is selected.

* Village Mines
  - terrain dependent structure.
  - where village road with no buildings goes into the side of a hill.
  - will include some empty chests.
  - needs to match with vanilla mineshafts.
  - future "miner" villager type digs new tunnel segments under here.

* Village Grove
  - non-flat (but accessible) section of land with lots of trees in a small area.
  - ground must be changed to dirt/grass if not already.
  - ensures plenty of trees for future "forester" villager type.
  - future forester villager harvests trees and replants them (with same type?)
  - should we include forester "accomodation" and chests of some sort?

* Tweaks to villager behaviour
  - Dump excess inventories in nearby chests (farmers, miners, foresters, etc)
  - a way to change villager professions?
    ~ pay them with emerald block (and maybe a tool) via the trade interface?
    ~ block could be changed to soemthing else with other mods present
  - Finite resources?

* Spawn-safing village structures?
  - spawn-safing entire villages?

* Safe tower in spawn chunk for easier early-game
  - get into the "meat" of the game faster. No worrying about the first night
  - great for fresh players at night in multiplayer

* Consider random "larger" villages with wider roads and bigger buildings.
  - i.e. more city-like.
  - could generate this at spawn with the spawn tower maybe?

* Consider templates for customisation of village/city buildings?
  - Better default models of existing buildings?
