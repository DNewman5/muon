Muon is a Forge mod for Minecraft 1.10.2 inspired by Quark.

Its primary focus is to improve and enhance Villages in keeping with 
the style and spirit of Vanilla Minecraft.

The main site for this mod is at http://muon.mc.izno.gd/

Muon is by nature a CoreMod. This means it hooks parts of the 
minecraft source in ways not usually required by Minecraft mods and 
is therefore minecraft-version specific. 

Versions for newer versions of minecraft may become available as we 
start playing them. :)

Every aspect of this mod has been given a config option so you can 
tweak it to your heart's delight and use as much or as little of it 
as you wish. 

Generally the config options that fix deficiencies in Vanilla default 
to True, and setting all options to False will revert to pure vanilla 
behaviour. Options that significantly enhance or change vanilla mechanics 
need to be enabled explicitly. The default settings should result in 
improved vanilla world generation and gameplay without adding anything new.

Future development direction is intended to add tweaks to the mechanics
of villagers, and add additional villager types for miners and foresters.

THIS MOD IS CURRENTLY *ALPHA* QUALITY.

All commited code has had rudimentary testing, but has not yet been 
given significant exercise in the real world of multiplayer minecraft.

If you want to use it in a modpack you are most welcome to with proper 
attribution, but please keep in mind that you will bear full 
responsibility for all support as a result of doing so. Also, dropping 
us a note to tell us where you're using it would be most appreciated!
